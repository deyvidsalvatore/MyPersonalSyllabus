# DEV001: Angular Essential Training Syllabus Website
Welcome to my personal projectâ€”a simple and fun syllabus website for the DEV001: Angular Essential Training course!

## Project Overview
This is a playful project where I've created a syllabus website for a hypothetical Angular training course. It's a great example of how you can use HTML and CSS to build a clean, visually appealing site.
